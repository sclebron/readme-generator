I created a command line application that will generate a README.md file with the information that the user inputs. An index.js file was utilized to prompt the user to enter information for the README file and create a README file with that information, and a generateMarkdown.js file was utilized to display the information in the README. The README includes a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contributors, test instructions, license information, and a questions sections with links to the creator's email and GitHub. There is a table of contents that links to the different sections of the README.
